xReact is a lightweight reactive HOC for React. Data flow in xReact is observable and unidirectional.

## Features

### Purely Functional, Declarative, and Monadic
In imperatively code, you have to describe verbose of how to process data.  With `xreact`, we simply define data transformations, then compose them to form data flow. There are no variables, no intermediate state, and no side effects in your data flow's data composition!

### Typesafe and scalable
xReact is 100% Typescript! Turn your runtime bugs into compile time errors, fail and fix early.

### High level but 0 cost abstraction
In Redux, reducers' use of `switch` statements can make them difficult to compose. Unlike reducers, the function `x` return is simply a function which can easily compose.

```js
const Counter = x(plan1)(x(plan2)(CounterView))
// is the same as
const plan1_x_plan2_x = compose(x(plan1), x(plan2))
const Counter = plan1_x_plan2_x(CounterView)
```

What really happen behind compose is actually ES6 style mixin, so there won't be any extra layer of HoC and no any performance overhead.

### Asynchronous made easy
Asynchronous functions, such as Promises, can be converted to a stream and then flat-mapped.

```js
intent$.filter(x=>x.kind=='rest')
  .flatMap(({url}) => fromPromise(fetch(url)))
```

where `fetch(url)` will return a `Promise`, and fromPromise will transform a `Promise` into `Observable`, so you can flat it in intent stream which is also a `Observable`.

### Reactive libs of your choice
xReact came with 2 FRP libs of choices, rxjs and mostjs, for any new libs you only need to implement the `StaticStream` with your preferred lib as Higher Kind Type, just like how we done for [mostjs](https://github.com/reactive-react/xreact/blob/master/src/xs/most.ts).

More details about HKT implementation in TypeScript is [here](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts), but you don't really need to know this.
